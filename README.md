This project is a web application built with Next.js that allows users to view and create posts. Post creation is facilitated through a Golang REST API, which communicates with another API developed in NestJS via RabbitMQ. The posts are ultimately stored in a Supabase database.

## Features

- View existing posts
- Create new posts
- Communication between Next.js frontend and Golang API
